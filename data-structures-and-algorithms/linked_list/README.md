#Linked List

##First feature 
Create a Node class that has properties for the value 
stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

##Second feature
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new 
node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

##Third feature
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that 
value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

##Forth feature
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns 
a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
