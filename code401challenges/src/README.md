# Insertion Sort

I will go through the basics of insertsion sort.

> - You want to keep the sorted seperate from the unsorted.
> - You will need to use a variablie "pivot" to keep the sorted and the unsorted seperate.
> - Using recursion could possible decrease the difficulty.

# Merge Sort

I will explain the way I desided to complete the merge sort.

>- The main thing you should remember for the merge sort is to keep seperating the array until you have one element still in the array.
>- While putting the array back together you should sort the array as elements are put back in the array (if needed).
>- Don't forget while seperation is happening you should constantly check left and right for sorting
