#Linked List

##First feature 
Create a Node class that has properties for the value 
stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

##Second feature
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new 
node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

##Third feature
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that 
value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

##Forth feature
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns 
a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

##Fifth feature 
I Created a new class Stack. This class will implement a stack functionality what ever is the last node to get added to the stack
will be the first one to come off. 

The methods added to the stack class are as follows: 
Push method which would add a new node to the top of the stack.
Pop method which  would pop the last node add of the stack and return the value
Peek method which would return the top node's value with out removing the top node

##Sixth feature 
I created a new class Queue. This class will implement functionality of a queue, the first node added will be the first
node to come out.

The methods added to the queue class are as follows:
Enqueue which will add a node to the queue
Dequeue which will remove a node from in the order that node was added to the queue
Peek which will look at the node the node that is first in the queue
